    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is an adapted version of <a href="https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/breakfast-burritos.html">this recipe</a> from once upon a chef.</p>
    <p>Shake up your eggs and bacon breakfast by wrapping it in a tortilla! (Plus some more tasty additions) These breakfast burritos are quick, simple, and taste delicious.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Cage-free Eggs</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 red onion</li>
        <li>1/4 large red bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>1 handful kale, or other hearty green</li>
        <li>1 dash each: black pepper and paprika</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded cheese of choice</li>
        <li>1 burrito-size tortilla
        <li>1/4 cup of your favorite salsa</li>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs with all spices and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat a large nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Add the vegetables and add a dash of black pepper and salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are fragarent but not soft. Transfer to a plate.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low. Add the eggs and scramble until just cooked through. Transfer to a plate.</li>
        <li>To assemble the burritos: spoon the salsa onto the tortilla followed by the vegetables, eggs, and cheese. Fold in both sides of the tortilla over the filling and roll, tucking in the edges as you go.</li>
        <li>Your burrito is ready to eat, however, I'd recommend heating a pan to medium heat and adding the assembled burrito. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown. Flip and repeat.</li>
    </ol>
